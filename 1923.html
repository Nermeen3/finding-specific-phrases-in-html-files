</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">Servidyne, Inc. provides comprehensive energy efficiency and demand response solutions,
sustainability programs, and other building performance-enhancing products and services to owners
and operators of existing buildings, energy services companies, and public and investor-owned
utilities.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">As used herein, the terms “we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company” refer to Servidyne, Inc. and its
subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context indicates otherwise.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">The Company was organized under Delaware law in 1960 to succeed to the business of A. R. Abrams,
Inc., which was founded in 1925 by Alfred R. Abrams as a sole proprietorship. In 1984, the Company
changed its state of incorporation from Delaware to Georgia. In 2006, the Company changed its name
from Abrams Industries, Inc. to Servidyne, Inc.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">The Company operates through one wholly-owned reportable segment, Building Performance Efficiency (“BPE”).
During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company sold its last owned income-producing property,
other than its corporate headquarters facility. As a result, the Company’s Real Estate Segment is
no longer considered a reportable segment. Accordingly, the Company has removed all references to
the Real Estate Segment from this annual report, and will not report results of the Real Estate
Segment in future periodic reports.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">On June&nbsp;26, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement to be acquired by Scientific Conservation,
Inc. (“SCI”) for $3.50 per share in an all-cash transaction. The Company’s board of directors has
approved the merger and has unanimously recommended that the Company’s shareholders vote in favor
of it at a special meeting of the shareholders to be held to consider the merger. The merger has
also been approved by the board of directors of SCI. The acquisition is subject to approval by
Company shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Company, as well as
other customary closing conditions, and is expected to be completed in the Company’s second fiscal
quarter ending October&nbsp;31, 2011. Shareholders representing approximately 56% of the voting power of
the Company have agreed to vote in favor of the merger, subject to termination of such agreements
with respect to approximately 27% of the voting power if Servidyne’s board should change its
recommendation supporting the merger. If the merger is approved and is consummated, the Company
will no longer be a publicly-traded company, and its shares will cease to be traded on the NASDAQ
Global Market. For more information, see Note 18 “Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial
statements, as well as the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June&nbsp;28, 2011.

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left"><b><i>We are subject to contractual restrictions in the merger agreement that may hinder operations
pending the merger.</i></b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">The merger agreement restricts our ability, without SCI’s consent, from operating the business
outside of the ordinary course or taking certain actions until the merger occurs or the merger
agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive
business opportunities and making other beneficial changes to our business prior to completion of
the merger or termination of the merger agreement.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left"><b><i>We will be subject to various uncertainties while the merger is pending that may cause disruption
and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, suppliers, or customers.</i></b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an
adverse effect on us. Although we intend to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects,
these uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is
completed, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us to seek to change or
terminate existing business relationships with us or not enter into new relationships or
transactions.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">Employee retention may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the merger, as
employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the
combined company. If, despite our retention efforts, key employees depart or fail to continue
employment with us because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a
desire not to remain with the combined company, our financial results could be adversely affected.
The loss of the services of key employees and skilled workers and their experience and knowledge
regarding our business could adversely affect our operating results and the successful ongoing
operation of our business should the merger not be consummated.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left"><b><i>Pending shareholder lawsuits could delay or prevent the closing of the merger. In addition, we
could spend significant sums defending or settling the lawsuits.</i></b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">The Company, SCI, SCI’s wholly-owned acquisition subsidiary, and the Company’s Board of Directors
have been named as defendants in two putative class action lawsuits filed by alleged shareholders
of the Company in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia challenging the proposed merger.
The complaints allege, among other things, that (a)&nbsp;the Company’s Board of Directors breached their
fiduciary duties by: (1)&nbsp;conducting an inadequate sales process that undervalued the Company; (2)
agreeing to unfairly preclusive deal protection measures; and (3)&nbsp;approving merger terms that
unfairly vest some of the corporate insiders with benefits not shared equally by other Company
shareholders; and (b)&nbsp;in one of the complaints, that the Company’s Board of Directors failed to
disclose material facts to shareholders in connection with the proposed transaction in its
preliminary proxy statement, filed with the SEC on July&nbsp;18, 2011. The complaints also allege that
SCI knowingly aided and abetted these fiduciary duty breaches. The complaints seek to enjoin the
merger and other remedies. See ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS below for further information.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">One of the conditions to closing the merger is that there be no pending legal proceedings
challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the merger. While the Company
believes the claims asserted in the lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend
against them, no assurance can be given that these lawsuits will not delay—or even prevent—the
closing of the merger. Moreover, the costs the Company incurs in defending or settling the
lawsuits may be material, regardless of whether the Company ultimately prevails.

materially impair our ability to continue to operate.

For instance, in June&nbsp;2010, we successfully closed on the sale of our owned shopping center in
Jacksonville, Florida, generating net cash proceeds of approximately $2&nbsp;million, and in December
2010, we successfully closed on the sale of our owned shopping center in Smyrna, Tennessee,
generating net cash proceeds of approximately $250,000. As a result, our real estate assets now
consist of only our corporate headquarters building in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia (which is subject to a $4.1 million mortgage); a
commercially zoned land parcel in North Ft. Myers, Florida; and commercially-zoned land parcels in
Oakwood, Georgia. In addition, given the recent decline in commercial real estate values in the
United States, the Company may be unable to sell any of its few remaining real estate assets at
acceptable prices, or at all, in the near future.

assets are not an element of our growth strategy, as we intend to dedicate our future capital
resources and management attention to growing the BPE business.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">Our ability to achieve earnings in recent years has been significantly dependent on achieving
capital gains from the sales of real estate properties. Most of the proceeds from these sales have
been invested in establishing and growing the BPE business. As a result, we have limited remaining
real estate holdings, and consequently, real estate capital gains cannot be depended upon as a
primary source for future earnings.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">In addition, as a result of these real estate dispositions, rental income, another source of our
historical earnings, has been negatively impacted. Accordingly, in order for us to improve
profitability in the future, the BPE business will need to be expanded sufficiently to produce
consolidated net earnings. There can be no guarantee, however, that the BPE business will be able
to produce sufficient earnings, if any, to replace the earnings contribution that was generated by
our former real estate segment in recent years, particularly in light of the BPE business’ lack of
a long-term track record of sustained profitability.

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">To date, our BPE business has yet to achieve sustained profitability. In light of the absence of a
proven long-term track record of sustained profitability for the BPE business, we cannot guarantee
that our growth strategy will be successful. If our growth strategy ultimately were to be
unsuccessful, our revenues, earnings and stock price would be adversely affected.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left"><b><i>Our earnings could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill and other assets.</i></b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">As prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States, we
undertake an annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets balances. This test is
performed during the third quarter of our fiscal year, unless there has been a triggering event
that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible impairment. Our most recently completed
annual test indicated that no impairment existed as of January&nbsp;31, 2011. Future impairment tests
could yield different results, however, depending upon such factors as our actual operating
performance being significantly different than our assumptions utilized in the testing, or as a
result of changes in our industry. Consequently, future tests may result in an impairment of
goodwill or other intangible assets, in which event we would be required to record a non-cash
charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which such impairment were
determined to exist. Our goodwill and other intangible assets at January&nbsp;31, 2011, were
approximately $8.6&nbsp;million, or approximately 34% of our total assets. At April&nbsp;30, 2011, they were
approximately $8.5&nbsp;million, or approximately 32% of total assets.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">Non-cash adjustments to other assets can also negatively affect our earnings. For instance, we
recorded non-cash charges during the current year of approximately $291,000 to increase the
valuation allowance on our state deferred income tax assets, as a result of our periodic review of
the recoverability of our deferred tax assets.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left"><b><i>The markets for our products, services and technology are very competitive and are becoming more
so; if we cannot successfully compete in those markets, our business could be materially and
adversely affected.</i></b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">The markets for our energy savings products, services and technology are highly competitive and
fragmented, and are subject to rapidly changing technologies, emerging competing products and
services, frequent performance improvements, and evolving industry standards. We compete against
not only smaller companies of similar size to us, but also against much larger traditional and
competitive energy efficiency services providers and energy services companies. We expect
competition in our markets to increase in the future because of the substantial near-term and
long-term growth potential of our markets. Competition could arise from both newly organized
businesses, as well as from business expansions by established enterprises into our markets.
Increased competition could cause us to reduce the price of our energy savings products and
services, and we could experience lower gross profit margins and slower growth, or even a loss of
market share.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">Many of our existing competitors, as well as many potential new competitors, have longer operating
histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial,
technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing and other resources than we do. This may enable these
competitors to develop and implement new and better product, service and/or technology offerings
more quickly than we can, and to adapt more rapidly to changes in customer requirements or
preferences. Greater resources may also enable competitors to promote their products more
effectively, or price them more attractively, than we can. Established larger enterprises may have
existing customer, vendor and partner relationships that may give
them a competitive advantage vis-à-vis our BPE offerings, and other competitors with greater resources may be more
attractive to potential new customers, vendors, partners and employees than we may be to them.

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">Consequently, we cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources, technologies,
portfolio of products and services, or marketing, sales and operating support capabilities to
compete successfully in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and
profits.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left"><b><i>Failure to adequately expand our sales force may impede our growth.</i></b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">We are dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers for our BPE business,
particularly large enterprise customers, and to help manage our customer base. We operate in a
very competitive marketplace for sales personnel with the advanced sales skills, technical
knowledge, industry experience, and existing customer relationships that we need. Our ability to
achieve significant growth in revenues in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in
recruiting, training, motivating and retaining a sufficient number of such qualified sales
personnel. New personnel require significant training. Our recent hires and planned new hires
might not prove to be as productive as we would like or expect, and we might be unable to hire a
sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we conduct or desire
to conduct business. If we cannot hire, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified and
productive sales personnel, our revenues and profitability could be adversely impacted, and as a
result, our growth could be impeded, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and
financial position.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left"><b><i>As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, sales cycles may become
longer and more expensive, and we may encounter pricing pressures and implementation challenges,
all of which could harm our business.</i></b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">We are seeking to continue our recent years’ success in obtaining additional larger enterprise
customers for our BPE offerings. As we target more of these customers, we anticipate potentially
facing greater sales and marketing costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in closing
sales. In this market segment, a customer’s decision to use our BPE products and services may be
an enterprise-wide decision, and if so, this type of sale could require us to provide greater
levels of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our building
performance-enhancing products and services.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">In addition, larger customers may demand more customization, enhanced integration services and
additional product features and services. As a result of these factors, new sales opportunities
may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual
customers, driving up the costs and the amount of time required to close sales and diverting
selling and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions. Because of
these factors, the risk of not closing a sale with a larger enterprise customer may be greater than
with smaller customers, and the results of such potential failure, due to higher costs and fewer
overall ongoing sales initiatives, also could be greater. Moreover, the purchasing power of larger
enterprise customers may result in lower profit margins.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left"><b><i>A limited number of customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and backlog. The loss
of, or any significant decrease in, business from these customers could have an adverse effect on
our results.</i></b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">A significant portion of our revenues and backlog for the fiscal year ended and as of April&nbsp;30,
2011, were derived from a relatively limited number of customers. In fiscal year 2011, we
generated approximately 25% of revenues from our largest customer, and our top five customers
accounted for approximately 60% of revenues. At April&nbsp;30, 2011, approximately 25% of our backlog
was due to one customer, and the top five customers accounted for approximately 52% of our backlog.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">This customer concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our revenues and operating
results. If we lose a significant customer, or if revenues or orders from significant customers
decline, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected. Additionally, if one of these customers is lost, or if revenues or orders from one or
more of these customers decline, we cannot assure you that we will be able to replace or supplement
the lost customers with others that generate comparable revenues or profits.

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left"><b><i>A portion of our revenues is derived from fixed price contracts, which could result in losses on
contracts.</i></b>
</div>


<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">A portion of our revenues and current backlog is based on fixed price or fixed unit price contracts
that involve risks relating to our potential responsibility for the increased costs of performance
under such a contract. Generally, under fixed price or fixed unit price contracts, we have to
absorb any increase in our costs not caused by a customer modification or other compensable change
to the original contract, whether due to inflation, inefficiency, faulty estimates or other
factors. There are a number of other factors that could create differences in contract
performance, as compared to the original contract price, including, among other things, differing
facility conditions, insufficient availability of skilled labor in a particular geographic location
and insufficient availability of materials.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left"><b><i>We often utilize subcontractors in performing services or completing projects, whose potential
unavailability or unsatisfactory performance could have a material adverse effect on our business
and financial position.</i></b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">We often utilize unaffiliated third-party subcontractors in order to perform some of our energy
engineering and consulting services, proprietary software and other IT development projects, much
of our energy savings maintenance, installation and retrofit projects, and most of our other
construction-related projects and services. As a consequence, we depend on the continuing
availability of, and satisfactory performance by, such subcontractors. Such subcontractors may not
be available at the times or in the quantities needed, or in the markets where we operate, or the
quality of work by such subcontractors may prove to be below acceptable standards.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">In addition, the subcontractors may be unable to qualify for payment and performance bonds to
ensure their performance or may be otherwise inadequately capitalized. Insurance protection
available to subcontractors for construction defects, if any, is increasingly expensive and may
become unavailable, and the scope of such protection may become greatly limited.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">If as a result of subcontractor problems or failures, we were unable to meet our contractual
obligations to our customers, or were unable to successfully recover sufficient indemnity from our
subcontractors or their bond or insurance carriers, then we could suffer losses which could
decrease our profitability, damage our customer relations, significantly harm our reputation, or
otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left"><b><i>If our security measures for our proprietary technology solutions were breached, and as a result
unauthorized access to a customer’s data were obtained, our BPE offerings could be perceived as not
being sufficiently secure, customers might curtail or stop using our products and services, and we
could incur significant losses and liabilities.</i></b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">Our proprietary technology solutions involve the storage of customers’ data and information,
whether locally on the customers’ own computers, or on our computers. Some of these proprietary
technology solutions also involve the transmission of such data and information. Security breaches
could expose us to partial or total loss of this data and information, potential litigation, and
possible liability.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">If security measures were breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance
or otherwise, during transfer of data and information to data centers or at any time, and, as a
result, someone were to obtain unauthorized access to any of our customers’ data and information,
our reputation might be damaged, our business might suffer, and we might incur significant losses
and liabilities.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change
frequently, and generally are not recognized until after being launched against a target, we might
be unable to anticipate such techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures on a timely
basis.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">If an actual or perceived breach of security were to occur, the market perception of the
effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose sales and customers, and our
business and financial potential could be harmed.

sales might not grow, or could even decline.</i></b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">The financial value to customers who utilize our energy efficiency products and services is usually
measured by the energy and utility cost savings to be realized over time. Accordingly, the return
on our customers’ investment for installing energy efficient products and services and the time
period necessary for our customers to recoup their initial investment in utilizing these products
and services are directly correlated with the prevailing retail market prices for energy. If the
price of energy and utility rates drop, customers’ energy savings and returns on investment from
energy efficiency products and services would be less, and the time period over which their
investment could be recovered through energy and utility costs savings would be extended.
Consequently, if energy prices were to decline, demand for our energy efficiency products and
services could decline as a result, as potential customers would be dissuaded from an upfront
investment that may not produce an attractive return on investment for some time.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">A decline in energy prices could not only negatively affect the level of sales of energy savings

business was established through several business acquisitions over the years. We compete for
acquisition opportunities with other companies that have significantly greater financial resources.
Therefore, there is a risk that we may be unable to complete an important acquisition because
another company may be able to pay more for a potential acquisition candidate or may be able to use
its financial resources to acquire a potential acquisition candidate before we could obtain the
requisite financing.

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">Even if we complete a desirable business acquisition on favorable terms, we may not be able to
successfully integrate any newly acquired company into existing operations on a timely basis.
Integration of a substantial business is a challenging, time-consuming and costly process. It is
possible that the acquisition itself or the integration process could result in the loss of the
acquired company’s management or other key employees, the disruption of the acquired company’s
business, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely
affect the acquired company’s ability to maintain good relationships with its suppliers, customers

</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">One of our key offerings is replacing existing lighting systems with newer, more energy efficient
lighting systems in various types of facilities. Replacing lighting systems can often involve
removing, handling and disposing of hazardous materials. Various federal, state and local laws
govern the handling of hazardous materials. Complying with environmental laws and regulations can
be costly. If we fail to comply, we could face liability from government authorities or other
third parties. Even in cases where we subcontract the disposal of such materials, we could face
potential liability. Judgments, fines or similar penalties for environmental non-compliance could
negatively affect our financial position and reputation.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left"><b><i>We are subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and required public
disclosure that have increased both the costs of compliance and the risks of noncompliance. As a
small public company, these costs of compliance may affect us disproportionately as compared with
larger competitors.</i></b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">As a public company, we are subject to the laws, rules and regulations, and standards of various
governing bodies, including the SEC, NASDAQ and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the
“PCAOB”), which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose
securities are publicly traded. The Company’s efforts to comply with these regulations have
resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, increased general and administrative
expenses and a diversion of management time and attention away from earnings-generating activities
to compliance activities.

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">In addition, because these laws, rules and regulations, and standards are subject to varying
interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes
available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and
additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If
we fail to satisfactorily address and remain in compliance with all of these laws, rules and
regulations, and standards, and any subsequent revisions or additions, our business may be
adversely impacted.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">Moreover, many compliance costs are not in direct proportion to the size of a particular company.
As a small public company, these costs might affect us disproportionately, particularly in
comparison to our larger public competitors. We may also be at a disadvantage vis-à-vis public
company compliance costs compared with privately held competitors that are not subject to the same
laws, rules and regulations, and standards.

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">At April&nbsp;30, 2011, we had a mortgage note payable of approximately $4.1&nbsp;million on our corporate
headquarters building, which is pledged as collateral on the note. The note matures on August&nbsp;21,
2012. Exculpatory provisions of the mortgage loan limit our liability for repayment to our
interest in the mortgaged property. The property’s current leasing status, physical condition, and
net operating income; global, national, regional, or local economic conditions; financial and
credit market conditions; the level of liquidity available in real estate markets; our financial
position; the terms and conditions or status of our other corporate loans; or other prior financial
commitments could impair our ability to refinance the mortgage debt on the corporate headquarters
building at a time when such refinancing might be necessary. Moreover, such refinancing might not
be available at acceptable terms, including in respect of loan principal amounts, interest rates,
amortization schedules, guaranties or maturity terms.

class action lawsuits, <i>Manzoor Hussain v. Servidyne Inc. et al</i>. (Civil Action No.&nbsp;2011-CV-202977),
filed July&nbsp;7, 2011, and <i>Brian Jacobs v. Servidyne, Inc. et al</i>. (Civil Action No.&nbsp;2011-CV-203489),
filed July&nbsp;22, 2011. Each lawsuit was brought by an alleged shareholder of the Company challenging
the merger and filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">The complaints allege, among other things, that (a)&nbsp;the Company’s Board of Directors breached their
fiduciary duties by: (1)&nbsp;conducting an inadequate sales process that undervalued the Company; (2)
agreeing to unfairly preclusive deal protection measures; and (3)&nbsp;approving merger terms that
unfairly vest some of the corporate insiders with benefits not shared equally by other Company
shareholders; and (b)&nbsp;in the complaint filed by Brian Jacobs, that the Company’s Board of Directors
failed to disclose material facts to shareholders in connection with the proposed transaction in
its preliminary proxy statement, filed with the SEC on July&nbsp;18, 2011. The complaints also allege
that SCI knowingly aided and abetted these fiduciary duty breaches. The complaints seek to enjoin
the merger and other remedies.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">The Company believes the claims asserted in the lawsuits are without merit and intends to
vigorously defend against them. However, these proceedings are in their early stages, and due to
the inherent uncertainty in litigation, there can be no guarantee that the Company will ultimately
be successful in these proceedings, or in others to which it is currently a party. Substantial
losses from legal proceedings could have a material adverse impact upon the Company’s business,
financial position or results of operations; adverse developments in the proceedings described
above could impede or prevent the merger from being consummated.

</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">The Company has one reportable operating segment, the Building Performance Efficiency, or BPE, Segment. The
Company continues to add new BPE products and service offerings, which may come in part from future
business acquisitions. Information previously reported as “Real
Estate” or “Parent” is now reported below as “Corporate” or “Other.”
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">In “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” below, changes in revenues, costs of revenues, selling, general and
administrative expenses, and loss from continuing operations before income taxes from period to
period are analyzed on a segment basis. For other information on a consolidated basis, please see
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">On June&nbsp;26, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement to be acquired by Scientific
Conservation, Inc. (“SCI”) for $3.50 per share in an all-cash transaction. The Company’s board of
directors has approved the merger and has unanimously recommended that the Company’s shareholders
vote in favor of it at a special meeting of the shareholders to be held to consider the merger.
The merger has also been approved by the board of directors of SCI. The acquisition is subject to
approval by Company shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Company,
as well as other customary closing conditions, and is expected to be completed in the Company’s
second fiscal quarter ending October&nbsp;31, 2011. Shareholders representing approximately 56% of the
voting power of the Company have agreed to vote in favor of the merger, subject to termination of
such agreements with respect to approximately 27% of the voting power if Servidyne’s board should
change its recommendation supporting the merger. If the merger is approved and is consummated, the
Company will no longer be a publicly-traded company, and its shares will cease to be traded on the
NASDAQ Global Market. For more information, see Note 18 “Subsequent Events” to the consolidated
financial statements, as well as the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June&nbsp;28, 2011.

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt" align="left"><b>OVERVIEW</b>
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">The Company entered fiscal year 2011 with  an order backlog at
its BPE Segment of $15.4&nbsp;million, which at that time represented the highest backlog achieved by
BPE in the Company’s history. The Company recognized historic levels of BPE revenues during fiscal
year 2011. In addition, BPE’s new order activity showed
continued strength in fiscal 2011.
BPE closed the year with a backlog of $13.9&nbsp;million as of April&nbsp;30, 2011.
The new order activity in fiscal 2011 included the award of a $5.8&nbsp;million design-build
retro-commissioning project for the Georgia Department of Corrections under a contract with the
Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, which the Company commenced during the fiscal second
quarter and expects to substantially complete by the end of calendar year 2011.

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">More specifically, BPE generated $25.7&nbsp;million in revenues, $556,000 in pre-tax earnings (including
intercompany costs and expenses), and $1,270,000 in EBITDA<sup style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">1 </sup>(pre-tax earnings, plus
interest, depreciation and amortization of $714,000) in fiscal 2011. The current year revenues
increased 42% compared to fiscal 2010, including a 70% year-over-year increase in Energy Savings
Projects revenues. During the fourth quarter, BPE generated $7.5&nbsp;million in revenues, a new record
for revenues recognized in a fiscal quarter, and generated $492,000 in pre-tax earnings (including
intercompany costs and expenses) and $648,000 in EBITDA (pre-tax earnings, plus interest,
depreciation and amortization of $157,000).

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">The Company believes that the  increase in BPE order activity, revenues and
profitability over the last year is a direct result of three distinct factors: the success of the
Company’s enhanced sales and marketing efforts, which were initiated in fiscal 2009; an overall
improvement in the capital spending environment for many BPE customers; and the infusion of U.S.
government expenditures for energy efficiency upgrades of government facilities. The Company
believes that these factors will continue to be favorable in fiscal year 2012. Management expects
that BPE will generate positive EBITDA in fiscal year 2012, exceeding the EBITDA achieved in fiscal
year 2011, with revenues and order activity remaining strong.
</div>

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">However, the Company on a consolidated basis in not expected to
generate positive EBITDA in fiscal 2012. Moreover, EBITDA on a quarterly basis
is more sensitive to fluctuations in the timing of revenues and may not be positive in an
individual quarter.  Management believes that a longer period of time will be required
before the BPE Segment is able to generate sufficient sustained cash flow to fully fund the
Company’s consolidated operations. See the “Liquidity” section below for more information.

<div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt" align="left">To support ongoing revenue growth, the Company anticipates continued strong order growth from
customers in the government sector, the private sector and from utility companies. The Company
offers government sector customers many of the same offerings it provides to private sector
customers, including energy savings projects and other energy efficiency-focused products and
services, by entering into direct contracts and by acting as a subcontractor to large energy
services companies (“ESCOs”). The Company has a long history of providing energy efficiency
services for a wide range of government facilities, including U.S. military bases, federal, state
and county prisons, large public educational facilities, municipal school districts, and a variety
of other federal, state, county and municipal buildings and facilities. The Company has existing
business relationships with a number of government entities and with several of the large ESCOs
currently authorized by the U.S. Department of Energy to perform federally-funded projects to
improve the energy efficiency of government buildings. In addition, the Company expects to build on
its recent successes in the private sector by continuing to broaden its customer base of Fortune
500 companies and large asset and property managers that own or manage numerous facilities across
the country, due to the growing corporate awareness of the solid investment potential of
sustainable and energy efficient facility upgrades. The Company also has recently developed
relationships with a number of major U.S. utility companies, who are actively seeking the Company’s
energy efficiency expertise, demand response services, project management capabilities, and
engineering and implementation services to offer to their end-use customers’ buildings and
facilities. Demand from utilities is growing rapidly, driven by increasing pressures on these
companies to provide more power without adding a commensurate amount of new generating capacity, as
construction of new generating plants in most regions of the U.S. is either politically unpopular
or economically unfeasible, or both. As the combined result of the many funded and proposed
